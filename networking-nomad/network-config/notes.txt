Network interfaces 
Its the way the kernel makes the connection between hardware and software, the command to check stuff is the 'ip'
we can configure and interact with our network with the ip commandTo show interface information for all interfaces


$ ip link show

To show the statistics of an interface
$ ip -s link show eth0

To show ip addresses allocated to interfaces
$ ip address show

To bring interfaces up and down
$ ip link set eth0 up
$ ip link set eth0 down

To add an IP address to an interface
$ ip address add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0


Route - > we alreayd know what routes are, these are a few commands to interact with routes.

$ sudo route add -net 192.168.2.1/23 gw 10.11.12.3
Delete a route

$ sudo route del -net 192.168.2.1/23 
You can also perform these changes with the ip command:

To add a route
$ ip route add 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3

To delete a route
$ ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3
$ ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23

dhclient 
we will rarely be interacting so directly with ips, subnetmasks and routes, most the time wthey will be created and given dinamically. thats what the dhclient files will manage and configure.

Network Manager
now if you want everything managed more automatically, we will use a NetworkManager, it manages hardware and softwareA tool commonly used is nm-tool, it reporsts the state of networkmanager and its devices

Arp 
Arp caches boots empty and goes on collecting mac information as packages move up and down

shows the arp cache
$ ip neighbour show
