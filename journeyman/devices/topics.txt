Devices

Connected devices need drivers to be used properly.
Drivers are the actual digital representation of the devices
We find their files in the /dev directory.
They are just files, as usual.

File types
c - character
b - block
p - pipe
s - socket

SCSI - Devices for mass storage  
Pseudo devices - not phisically connected to the machine
PATA devices -> old school representation

Sysfs - extended tooling for devices, contains info about the devices on the system, it is a 100% virtual system.

udev - helps in creating and managin new/old devices, back in the day we would have to create them manualy, down to the directory creation.

There are listing commands specificly for devices, like lsusb, lspci, lsscsi

dd -> very powerfull command, can backup entire disks and restoring backup images
it is basically a command to transfer data from a place to another. 
ex: $ dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024
This one need further investigation before messing with it.
