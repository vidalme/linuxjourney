Network sharing

scp is the command for transfering data from host to other computers in our network.

To copy a file over from local host to a remote host
$ scp myfile.txt username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory

To copy a file from a remote host to your local host
$ scp username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory/myfile.txt /local/directory


Rsync is similar to scp but checks for changes before copying stuff, also verifies integrity, its a great tool.

Copy/sync files on the same host
$ rsync -zvr /my/local/directory/one /my/local/directory/two

Copy/sync files to local host from a remote host
$ rsync /local/directory username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory

Copy/sync files to a remote host from a local host
$ rsync username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory /local/directory
