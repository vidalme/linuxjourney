OSI Model - is a theretical model of a network, it is the model we use.
it defines how a packet travel through the network, it is divided in seven steps each one with its onw specific tasks and rules.
The OSI model gave birth to the TCP/IP

TCP/IP -> its a protocol suit where those protocols are standards on how data is gathered, addressed, transmited and routed through a network.

Application layer -> its where we all interact, its job is to get data ready to be sent to the transport laye, as far as I know, it basically just dumps it on the transport layer.
protocols used -> http/smtp

Transport Layer -> How data will be transmited, check ports and integrity of data.
protocols used -> TCP/UDP

Network Layer -> it specifies how to move the packets between host and networks
tooling -> IP / ICMP

Link Layer -> it tells how to send data (now with all details we need it to find its way)across the actual phisical tooling, ethernet, fibers, cabels...
