ICMP
icmp is part of the tcp/ip protocol suite.Very helpfull in debugging netweork issues as failed packet deliverey.
Each ICMP message has a type that gives us a broad idea of the problem.
There is also a sub type that funnels the issue further, very powerfull.
BOth types and subtypes are represented by numbers.


Type 0 - Echo Reply
Type 3 - Destination Unreachable
Type 8 - Echo Request
Type 11 - Time Exceeded

ping
one of the simplest yet most helpfull commands. send an echo request to the server and back, then displays a few details about the traject.
ex: 
ping -c 3 www.google.com
the  flag -c is for limiting the number of hops this packet will livefor.

ttl -> hop counter, it makes sure packets wont be bouncing around the network ad infinitum.

traceroute
it works like a ping but with different steps, each step tryingot to reach further into the complete path.

ss (replaced the netstat edscibed in the tutorial)
extremely powerfull command,gives us detailed information on network connections, routing tabels, it is trully the swiss army knife of network debugging commands.

ss -at
the option -a shows all, listening and non-listening sockets, the -t for tcp only.

Packet analysis
very extensive subject, books are written only about this.
2 most known analyzing apps are Wireshark and tcpdump
so much can be seen in a deeper analisys.
