Subnetting

IPv4 everything connected to the network needs an IP, its their address

Subnets -> a group of hosts inter connected under a certain range of IPs

Subnet Math -> the way we calculate  ips ranges and their binarie numbers

Subnetting cheats -> how to do the conversion of IP

CIDR -> an alternative way to describe a IP range that forms a subnet

NAT -> its the endpoint of a subnet, the recepcionist of a network really, everyone who wants to talk to our subnet will go through our NAT gate

IPv6 -> expanded on IP4, almost the same but more slots available
