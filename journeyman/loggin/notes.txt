System logging

services, kernel, daemons, etc... are constantly doing something, the data of those activities are saved in forms of logs, they are usually located inside the /var directory

The service responsible for doing taht is the syslog
unfornutally syslog is not a central hub for all logging events, there are many services which use their own logging rules.

we can use the service syslog with the commmand logger, in fact we can just type it right into the console. logger -s Hello and it will be sent by the syslog and written in a specific file

configuration file for the syslog   /etc/rsyslog.d

general logging
there are several log files but the most important ones are

/var/log/messages
/var/log/syslog

Kernel loggin
also the kernel during the booting generates a lot of logs, they can be found in 
/var/log/dmesg (booting information)
/var/log/kern.log (events of the system)

Authentication logging

/var/log/auth.log
auth gets special treatment, we will not find its loggings inside a regular loggin file, they keep their stuff in the auth.log file.

Managing log files
Log files generate a lot of data, and it will pile up.
Linux has a logrotate function to preventa that from happening.
With it we can set clean up service for older logs and whatnot
