Trackin processes

top -> this is the most used command, it really gives us a complete overwview of what our processes are doing.
lsof -> lists all the open files (lsof = list open files) exclent to check for processes that are blcoking our machine.
fuser -> information about the process that is uysing a specific file.

Process threads ->
A thread is like a small task of a process, like a google chrome would be a process while the ability to open a url and bookmark it at the same time would be a multi thread ability of this process.

All proceses start by themselves but they can create/kill multiple threads.

CPU monitoring -> uptime

I/O monitoring -> reasearch for a more apropriate tool for monitoring our disk usage. This one is not in my ubuntu 22 by default and I believe there must be one out thre that comes with ubuntu22

Memory monitoring -> vmstat / great command, very powerfull, needs more reading into ti but I can already tell its a very fgood one for monitoring.

Continuoous monitoring -> sar / good tool to save data monitored throughout the day when we are not looking, it gives us those sum ups in the end of the day of what happened.

Cron jobs -> schedule script to run whenever we want and as often as we want.
