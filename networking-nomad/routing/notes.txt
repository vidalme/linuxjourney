Routing

What is a router?
A router is a device (phisically or not) that will know what to do with data sent from a place to another ni a network.

Hops -> are any points where data will check during its travelling from a to b.

Router takes care of those 2 jobs
Switching - receiving, processing and forwarding data
Routing - process of creating the routing table so we can switching better.

Routing table -> the plan, where and how data can move around
Destination, gateway, genmask (subnet mask), flags, Iface (the interface the packet will go to)

Path of packet
This explained how the packet travelling differs when in a local network vs outside its network.
Its a process with several steps with focus on aquiring 4 itens

source IP
target IP
source MAC address
target MAC address

The main difference is how we aquire the target MAC address when travelling outside the network, since it canot load localy the ARP service (it only works within its onw network)

Routing protocols
Convergece ->its how the wholenetwork gets the same information on how the network lookslike and functionalities.

Distance vector protocols
good for smaller networks, cant scale at all.
15 hops limit

Link state protocols
way more complext but can scale very well.
they do not periodically send route tables everywherer, they only send updates to neighbors.
the most common link state protocol is OSPF, only updates when there was an actual change to the network and also there is no hop limits

Border Gateway Protocol BGP
this is the way networks talk to networks, the very foundation of the internet, thatsw the main idea of the whole thing, a network of networks.
