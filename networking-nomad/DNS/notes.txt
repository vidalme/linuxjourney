What is DNS?
DNS allows the internet to use easy domain names for humans while at the same time translates everything for machine language, IPs.

DNS components
Name server
They are the bootloaders for a dns search, its who configures and sets it up, its where we go as well to ask for some questions about what we are looking for.

Zone fiel
if name servers are librarians in a library, zone files would be the shelves keeping the books (resource records)

Reource Reocrds
keeping the same metaphor, resource records would be the books with the actual information of the IP we are lookig for.,

DNS process

Local DNS server 
dns first looks inside our own machine.

Root servers
those are 13 root servers spread out around the globe, they will direct us in the right direction.

Top-Level Domain
Here we will funnel up the search by .com, .info, .net... etc.

Authoritatve DNS server
here lies our target, the actual container of the data we are looikuing for

/etc/hosts
this is our internal database of dns addresses, we can fidge it with but not recomended, we normally should be using a manager for that


DNS setup
BIND is the most popular DNS server on the internet.

DNS tools

we have 2 commands nslookup and dig (it seems dig is the best choice with more flexibility and robustness)

dig www.google.com
