package repositories are provided byy everyone who wants to make them, thats a convenient way for linux users to download and install software. Also the distro which we are using already comes with its onw collection of softwares pre-installed and aproved.

Tar and Gzip -> archiving and compressing. 
Archiving can pile up many files into a single convenient file.
Gzip will make it compressed (smaller

Almost every package has dependecies, they rarely work alone)

dpkg -> debian, ubuntu, mint...-> apt
rpm -> red hat, centos, fedora... -> yum

For compiling source code we will need to do some extra work, look it up, wont memorize this.
