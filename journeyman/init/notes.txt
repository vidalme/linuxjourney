init 
System V overview
the main purpose of init is to start and stop essential processes on the system.
3 main implementations of init; System V, Upstart and systemd

system v runs sincroniously, in other words, it is ordened and if youhavee a service a, the next service b will only start after a isr ready. thats good for debugging, but slow to run.

Upstart -> developed to fix the weaknesses of system v (slow and task blokcin)it was created by canonical for ubuntu, but it is already dead, instead ubuntu uses systemd much more frequently.


Upstart jobs -> we canm define jobs which are tasks for jobs to do, once they run they can broadcast events to listeners who are themselves another jobs.

Systemd -> its the default right now, more used than any other option and what we should focus our knowledge at. its fast and flexible.
it can do much more than start and stop services, can also mount and target units.
The maibn pbject system d works with are goals, they are specific for each type of task, like mount, target and services.

Systemd Goals -> the actual doing of things, we access them through command in the cli
ex:
List units

$ systemctl list-units
View status of unit

$ systemctl status networking.service
Start a service

$ sudo systemctl start networking.service
Stop a service

$ sudo systemctl stop networking.service
Restart a service

$ sudo systemctl restart networking.service
Enable a unit

$ sudo systemctl enable networking.service
Disable a unit

$ sudo systemctl disable networking.service

I must research much more about systemd, no doubt about it this is an important topic and we barely touched it

Power states -> these are the states the system is at, like shutown, restart..
$ sudo shutdown -h +2
This will shutdown your system in two minutes. You can also restart with the shutdown command:

$ sudo shutdown -r now
Or just use the reboot command:

$ sudo reboot
